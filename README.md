This is just a repository for a basic node scraper.  This is pretty much all data gathered from https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js so I take no credit for it.


### A Note on Web Scraping

Web scraping falls within a gray area of the law. Scraping data for personal use within limits is generally ok but you should always get permission from the website owner before doing so. Our example here is using publicly accessibly data from a tax payer funded website. Scraping very often and very quickly usually results in scrapers being disallowed.  Please scrape responsibly.
