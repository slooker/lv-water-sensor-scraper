This is just a repository for a basic node scraper.  This is pretty much all data gathered from https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js so I take no credit for it.


### A Note on Web Scraping

Web scraping falls within a gray area of the law. Scraping data for personal use within limits is generally ok but you should always get permission from the website owner before doing so. Our example here was very minimalistic in a sense (we only made one request to IMDB) so that it does not interfere with IMDBâ€™s operations. Please scrape responsibly.
